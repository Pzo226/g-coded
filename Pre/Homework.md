# Homework:

Let me elaborate on your homework:
Your homework before this class was to do the prerequisites.
Watch the videos write down at least two questions per video. The videos are in previous programming 101.

Since we have some extra time to start, I would like you to create your tech twitter, and update your linkedIn. I'm going to announce the new concept of G-coded and I'm going to tag you all in the post. If we're not connected on [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/bclincy) connect now.
