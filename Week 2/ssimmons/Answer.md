Job Decription 1:
I would apply to this position for number of reasons. 
1. It is related to web developement, which is what I am 
interested in.
2. I feel that the required tech stack experience is obtainable for me.
3. The position is possibly remote, which is highly favorable 
to me.
The only issue is there is not a listed salary margin, and this job is demanding a lot of experience so I would expect a decent salary.

Job Decription 2: 
I would not apply to this job because project management does not peek my interest at the moment. I do not desire to manage or lead people.
